## App Features

1. Desktop & mobile styling for responsiveness.
2. Seemless navigation between pages, thanks to React-Router-Dom.
3. A storefront that contains items that can be browsed & added to a shopping cart.
4. A pop-up shopping cart that can be viewed on any page and can be used to update one's items.

## Instructions

1. Click on "SHOP NOW" on the home page or "Shop" in the top navbar to navigate to the shop page.
2. Browse items in the shop page and add them to your cart by clicking "Add to Cart".
3. Click on the shopping cart icon in the top-right corner to view the shopping cart.
4. Increase or decrease the quantity of each item in your cart by clicking the plus and minus buttons.

## Areas for Improvement

1. Despite being a faux ecommerce site with no backend, it would be nice to add a checkout page that summarizes the user's shopping cart items.
2. Adding a pop-up option for each store item, with a description & more details about the item itself, would add depth to the storefront.

## Known Issues

1. Shopping cart items do not persist on reload / refresh.
